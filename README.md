# 2048-2AA4-Project
A copy of my previous work implementing the functionality of the game "2048" for my course 2AA4: Introduction to Software Development

The files are in the folder "A4" because it was my fourth assignment in that course. 

To play the game, use the command "make demo" in the "A4" folder and use the "wasd" keys to play.
Displays 2048 game using ASCII text.
